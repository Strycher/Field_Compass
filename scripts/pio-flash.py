scripts/pio-flash.py - flash-discipline wrapper (Python body)

FIELD COMPASS DEPLOYMENT (Strycher/Field_Compass#172). Ported from
meshcore-firmware with NO behavioural changes - only this docstring differs.
Keep it that way: divergent hand-edited copies are the problem tracked in
DifferentWire/standards#259.

Reads PROJECT_ROOT/hardware-devices.yaml, where PROJECT_ROOT is resolved
RELATIVE TO THIS SCRIPT (not a hardcoded path), so the wrapper works inside
worktrees. This repo's registry is TRACKED IN GIT - the meshcore and wadamesh
copies are not, which is why pio-flash refuses in most of their worktrees.

Enumerates present USB serial ports via Windows PowerShell, and gates all
device-touching operations on:

  Tier 0  (free)         passive enumeration ('list' subcommand)
  Tier B  (identity-gate) port-opening read-only ('monitor', 'info')
  Tier A  (full gate)    state-changing ('upload', 'read-mac', 'bootstrap')
                          requires preview -> token -> confirm two-stage

Tracks:   Strycher/Field_Compass#172 (this port), Strycher/LoRa#47 (original)
Registry: <repo>/hardware-devices.yaml (tracked)
Hook:     .claude/hooks/block-raw-flash.py
Proposal: C:\\Dev\\LoRa\\proposal-flash-discipline.md
Fleet:    DifferentWire/standards#259 (registry fragmentation)

Field Compass board identity (captured from hardware 2026-08-09):
  app mode:        239A:811B  Adafruit TinyUSB CDC
  bootloader mode: 303A:1001  Espressif USB-JTAG
Cross-vendor, but BOTH report usb serial b8:f8:62:d5:44:40 on their parent USB
device, so serial-first discovery in _discover_bootloader_port works unmodified.
Note the interface DeviceID tail ("8&52BB9D8&0&0000") is a hub path, NOT the
serial - PS_ENUMERATE resolves the parent, which is why it gets this right.

Usage:
    pio-flash list
    pio-flash preview  <device> --env <pio-env>
    pio-flash preview  <device> --artifact <path> [--erase]
    pio-flash confirm  <device> --token <token-file>
    pio-flash monitor  <device> [--env <env>] [--baud 115200]
    pio-flash info     <device>
    pio-flash read-mac <device>
    pio-flash backup   <device> [--output <path>] [--size <bytes>]
    pio-flash bootstrap <name> --port <COMx>

Exit codes:
    0  success
    1  error (registry, args, refusal, etc.)
    2  preview-only success (token written, did NOT flash)

    On CP2102-bridged ESP32 boards (notably Heltec V3), DTR/RTS are physically

    PlatformIO only picks up those env-scoped settings when monitor is
    invoked with `-e <env>`. Pass --env here to forward that through.
    Without --env on a CP2102 board, monitor open WILL reset the chip;
    a stderr warning is emitted so the operator sees this before the device
